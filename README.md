# SICM-toolbox
Set of Matlab scripts and classes to handle SICM data.

Please note: The class SICM.SICMScan is considered stable, but the GUI and all related components are not and might change. We have switched to an appdesigner-based GUI, which is not so nice to handle via a version control system and we might thus change back to a uix-based GUI. The current attempts here might not work. 

This software is designed for use in our laboratory, thus we will most likely not respond the feature requests from others, although bug reports are welcome.
