# SICM-toolbox
Set of Matlab scripts and classes to handle SICM data.

Please note: The class SICM.SICMScan is considered stable, but the GUI and all related components are not and might change. 

This software is designed for use in our laboratory, thus we will most likely not respond the feature requests from others, although bug reports are welcome.
