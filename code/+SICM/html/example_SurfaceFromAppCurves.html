Moving the piezo by such small distances requires suitable equipment, as long as no data is recorded during the movement as we do in pulse mode. Given a DA-board with a sampling range of 16 bit (2^16) which maps to 0 to 10V (which is the input voltage of the piezo),  using a 100&micro;m piezo, the minimal output is:</p><pre class="codeinput">100/(2^16)

%% Getting a surface from fits of the approach curves
% This file is a tutorial, showing how to get a surface from fits of the
% approach curves. The data is stored in the folder |tut1| of the |+SICM|
% folder. 
%
% First, load the scan:

scan = SICM.SICMScan.FromFile(['tut1' filesep 'scan01_07.sic'])

%%
% and display the data:
figure('Position',[30 30 800 375]);
plot(scan); view(15,-70);

%%
% The approach curves are located in the folder |scan01_07_ACs|. The file
% names of the approach curves is a combination of the string
% 'scan_01_07_', followed by the pixel number (starting from 0) and the
% file extension '.ac'. 
% 
% To read the approach curves in a single run, we can use the
% |readAllAppCurves| method. The input argumeńt of this method is a
% function handle, pointing to a function which accepts three arguments
% (|x|, |y| and |i|), where |x| and |y| are the |x|- and |y|-coordinates of
% the current data point an |i| is the current pixel number.  The function
% should return the corresponding file name of the current approach curve.
% A suitable function would be:

getAppCurveFileName = @(x, y, i)(...
    sprintf('tut1/scan01_07_ACs/scan01_07_%g.ac', i-1));

%%
% We than call |readAllAppCurves| with the handle of this function:

scan.readAllAppCurves(getAppCurveFileName);

%%
% Plot one of the approach curves to see whether it really worked:
clf;
plot(scan.approachcurves{5,7});

%% 
% To detila the steps required to obtain the surface from the approach
% curve, we will use this approach curve as an example. So, let's get a
% copy of the curve object. We use the static method |fromSICMAppCurve_|
% for this:

app = SICM.SICMAppCurve.fromSICMAppCurve_(scan.approachcurves{5,7});

%%
% Approach curves could have different characteristics: First, the change
% in the y-value when reaching the surface is either an increase or a
% decrease, depnding on whether SICM was operated in VC or CC mode (or
% whether resistance or conductance were recorded). Second, the change in
% resistace can either occur at increasing or decreasing x-values,
% depending on how the pipette is mounted in the SICM. Both informations
% are required for fitting the data. You can either set these
% characteristics manually, for example:
%
%   app.setMode(SICM.SICMAppCurves.modes.VC);
%   app.setDirections(SICM.SICMAppCurves.directions.DEC);
%
% or you can tell the object to try to find mode and direction autmatically
% by calling

app.guessCurveType();

%%
% The curve shonw above has a drop in the y-value (the current has been
% recorded), hence it is in VC mode. To test whether this has been
% automatically detected, use:

app.isVCMode()

%% 
% The results 1 corresponds to |True|, hence the mode of the app curve is
% VC. Furthermore, the drop occurs when the x-values decrease, hence the
% direction should be decreasing:

app.isDEC()

%%
% Additionally, |guessCurveType()| has set a fit function for the approach
% curve object:

app.fitfunc

%%
% Thus, we can try to fit this function to the data and view the results:
clf;
app.fit();
app.plotAll();

%% 
% Let's zoom into the interesting part of the data and the fit and plot the
% threshold, too;

set(gca,'Xlim',[57 57.8]);
set(gca,'Ylim',[1250 1450]);
hold on;
plot([57 57.8], [app.fitobject.I0*.975, app.fitobject.I0*.975, ],'kREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH');

%%
% We see that the last few data point impact the fit dramatically. To
% optimize the fit for a certain Threshold, we can use

app.fitToThreshold(.975);

%% 
% You see that a warning was raised since the autometd fit porcess
% encountered an infinite loop, and hence automatic fitting was stopped.
% However, this is not necessarily a problem, let's add the new fit to the
% plot... 

x = linspace(app.inversefitfunc(...
    app.fitobject.I0, app.fitobject.C, app.fitobject.D,...
    .975 * app.fitobject.I0), 59, 200);

plot(x, feval(app.fitobject, x), 'k-');
set(gca,'Xlim',[57 57.8]);
set(gca,'Ylim',[1250 1450]);

%%
% While the new fit might not be perfect, it is much better than the first
% one. To see the strategy used to fit to a certain threshold, look at the
% code of the method SICMAppCurve.fit.
%
% We now have to repeat these steps for all approach curves in the scan
% object (expect a lot of warnings):

% There have been a lot of arnings. However, let's generate a new surface
% from the approach curves: 

scan2 = scan.updateZDataFromFit(0.975);

clf; 
subplot(1,2,1);
plot(scan); title('Original data'); view(15,-70);
subplot(1,2,2);
plot(scan2); title('Updated data'); view(15,-70);

%% 
% While the data looks less crowdy, some peaks occur which are most likely
% due to improper fitting. If a automated fit process was stopped due to an
% infite loop, the corresponding |fitproblems| property of the AppCurve
% object is set to one. To receive a map of problemativ fits, we can loop
% over the approach curves using |cellfun|:

problems = cellfun(@(x)(x.fitproblems), scan2.approachcurves);
clf;
subplot(1,2,1); 
imagesc(scan2.zdata_grid); title('Surface');axis image;
subplot(1,2,2); 
imagesc(problems);title('Problems');axis image;

%%
% The problematic fits can now be investigated an optimized manually.
% However, some of the fits might be ok, although they encountered an
% infinite loop. They can be reviewed using
%
%   scan.reviewProblematicFits()
%
% I omit this here since it woul results in about 150 images in this file. 
%
% Instead, let's inspect a curve manually:
clf;
app = scan.getAppCurve(4);
app.plotAll();

%% 
% Indeed, the fit isn't very good. To start a manual fit session, use:
% 
%   app.fittool();
%
% Assume, you have saved the fit in |appfit|, you can set the fit of the
% approach curve by
%
%   app2 = app.setFitobject(appfit);
% 
% After one has reviewed and, if necessary, fitted all data, the surface
% looks like this:
%
%   scan3 = scan.updateZDataFromFit(0.975);

clf; 
subplot(1,2,1);
plot(scan); title('Original data'); view(1,0); 
set(gca, 'ZLim', [56.9 57.3]);
set(gca, 'XLim', [0 max(scan.xdata_lin)]);
subplot(1,2,2);
plot(scan3); title('Reviewed and improved data'); view(1,0); 
set(gca, 'ZLim', [56.9 57.3]);
set(gca, 'XLim', [0 max(scan3.xdata_lin)]);

%% 
% It is obvious that the data has changed, but not really improved. Let's
% look at the C-values from the fits:

C = cellfun(@(x)(x.fitobject.C), scan3.approachcurves);
clf;
imagesc(C);
colorbar;

%%
% First of all, there is a data point which has a negative C-value, which
% is impossible. This might be either due to bad automatic or manual
% fitting. Next, the values differe quite a lot. 
%
% There are two reasons for this:
%
% * insufficient data sampling
% * to noisy data.
%
% If we use the data from Denis' Analytical Chemistry paper, the value for
% |C| is approximately |0.005 r|, where r is the pipette radius (of course
% this value might differ due to a different opening angle of the pipettes
% used here. However, the order of magnitude should be the same. If we omit
% the negative C-value here and lokk at the median C-value, we recieve

C = C(C>=0);
Cm = median(C)

%% 
% If we compar the to the opening radius of approximately 50 nm, we get

Cm/.05

%% 
% which is in the same order of magnitude as in Denis paper. Let's draw an
% approach curve using Cm:

x = linspace(0.001,.2, 2000);
clf;
plot(x, (1+Cm./x).^-1);
set(gca,'XLim',[-.05, .2]);
set(gca,'YLim',[0.9, 1.050]);
hold on;

%%
% Assume we have a noise of 1% of I0 (which is not true, the noise
% dramatically increases with decreasing current).

plot([-.05 .2], [.99 .99], 'REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH','Color',[.5 1 .5]);
plot([-.05 .2], [.975 .975], 'kREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH');
legend({'data', 'noise', 'threshold'});

%%
% If we compute the x-values at which the approach curve crosses the noise
% and the threshold lines

x1 = Cm/(1/0.99 -1);
x2 = Cm/(1/0.975 -1);

%% 
% and also add them to the plot:

plot([x1 x1],[.9 1.05], 'r-');
plot([x2 x2],[.9 1.05], 'r-');

%%
% we see the narrow region which is important do detect the surface and to
% fit an approach curve. This distance is:

x1-x2

%%
% Hence, if we approach with a sampling rate of 100nm^-1, this rate is
% approxiamtely 3 times the size, hence it is very likely that we miss this
% area. However, which step size would be sufficient? Let's say, we want to
% sample the interestingregion with at least 10 data points. We than need a
% step size of approximately 3 nm. Moving the piezo by such small distances
% requires suitable equipment, as long as no data is recorded during the
% movement as we do in pulse mode. Given a DA-board with a sampling range
% of 16 bit (2^16) which maps to 0 to 10V (which is the input voltage of
% the piezo),  using a 100µm piezo, the minimal output is:

100/(2^16)

%% 
% This shows that a stpe size of approximateyl 1nm is the minimum which can
% be technically achieved in pulse mode using a 100µm piezo, hence
% recordings with pipettes like this are very close to the limit of the
% instrument.
